<h1>Who am I?</h1>
<body> 
Hi there, my name is Lexi Hignell. I was born and raised in the Comox Valley, I quite like it here but I've definitely taken my chance to go live elsewhere on the island.
I left home the first time and moved to Whistler at 17 years old. That only lasted three months. A couple years later was searching for employment in Victoria. I ended up getting
a job I had always wanted. Working as a Legal assitant at Notarys on Douglas. About a years time goes by and I end up sick of the city and I moved home.

<h2> Web Experience </h2>
<body>
Although you may be able to tell, I dont have much experience at all with coding or any sort of graphic design. Before signing up for this course I did watch small tutorial videos as somewhat of an introductory
 to html. I managed to make a website similar to this one. Thats about as far as my experience goes.

 <h2> Do I know any coding languages? </h2>
 <body> 
     I do not know any coding languages at this point in time, but check back by the end of this course, and bet you I will!

 <h3> What are my expectations from this course?</h3>
 <body> 
  What I expect to learn in this course is the basics of HTML, and how to fully understand it and be able to put it all together to create web sites.
